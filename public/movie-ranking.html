<h2> My top 3 movies I've watched in 2024</h2>
<hr \>

<h3>Top 1: Lovely Runner</h3>
<p>I'm in love with a chemitry between 2 main actor and actress. <br \>
I would replay that movie every time I feel bored!
</p>

<h3>Top 2: Queen Of Tears</h3>
<p>It ends in March 2024, but now I still listen to its OST. <br \>
    Whenever I listen to its OST, I would imagine love time of main characters.
</p>

<h3>Top 3: Love Next Door</h3>
<p> I don't have time to watch it fully. However, I've followed that movie on Tiktok. <br \>
   I'm into main characters' visual and that shines through screen.
